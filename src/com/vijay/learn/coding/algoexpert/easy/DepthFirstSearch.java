Depth-first Search

  You're given a Node class that has a name and an
  array of optional children nodes. When put together, nodes form
  an acyclic tree-like structure.

  Implement the depthFirstSearch method on the
  Node class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree
  using the Depth-first Search approach (specifically navigating the tree from
  left to right), stores all the nodes' names in the input array, and returns
  it.

  If you're unfamiliar with Depth-first Search, we recommend watching the
  Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before
  starting to code.

Sample Input
graph = A
     /  |  \
    B   C   D
   / \     / \
  E   F   G   H
     / \   \
    I   J   K

Sample Output
["A", "B", "E", "F", "I", "J", "C", "D", "G", "K", "H"]

HintsHint 1
The Depth-first Search algorithm works by traversing a graph branch by branch. In other words, before traversing any Node's sibling Nodes, its children nodes must be traversed. How can you simply and effectively keep track of Nodes' sibling Nodes as you traverse them, all the while retaining the order in which you must traverse them?

Hint 2

Start at the root Node and try simply calling the depthFirstSearch method on all of its children Nodes. Then, call the depthFirstSearch method on all children Nodes of each child node. Keep applying this logic until the entire graph has been traversed. Don't forget to add the current Node's name to the input array at every call of depthFirstSearch.
